# Community Meeting: January 11 and 18, 2024

## Hit the Ground Running

Another set of `bpfman` Community Meetings for 2024.
There is a lot going on with `bpfman` in Q1 of 2024.
Spending a lot of time making `bpfman` [daemonless].
I bailed for a ski trip after the Jan 11 meeting, so the notes didn't get written up.
So this summary will include two weeks of meetings.

Below were some of the discussion points from the last two weeks Community Meetings.

* Manpage/CLI TAB Completion Questions (Jan 11)
* Kubernetes Support for Attaching uprobes in Containers (Jan 11)
* netify Preview in Github Removed (Jan 11)
* RPM Builds and Socket Activation (Jan 18)
* KubeCon EU Discussion (Jan 18)

### Manpage/CLI TAB Completion Questions (Jan 11)

The `bpfman` CLI now has TAB Completion and man pages.
However, a couple nits need to be cleaned up [Issue#913] and Billy ([@billy99])
wanted to clarify a few issues encountered.
The current implementation for both features  is using an environment variable to
set the destination directory for the generated files.
Other features don't work this way and there was a discussion on the proper location
for the generated files.
The decision was to use `.output/.`.

There was another discussion around `clap` (Rust CLI crate) and passing variables
to `clap` from the Cargo.toml file.
In the CLI code, `#[command(author, version, about, long_about = None)]` implies
to pull the values from the Config.toml file, but we arenâ€™t setting any of those
variables.
Also, for `cargo xtask build-man-page` and `cargo xtask build-completion` they pull
from the xtask Cargo.toml file.
The decision was to set the variables implicitly in code and not pull from Cargo.toml.

### Kubernetes Support for Attaching uprobes in Containers (Jan 11)

Andre ([@anfredette]) is working on a feature to enable attaching uprobes in other
Containers.
Currently, `bpfman` only supports attaching uprobes within the `bpfman` container.
There was a discussion on proper way to format a query to the KubeAPI server to
match on NodeName on a Pod list.
The discussion included so code walk through.
Andrew ([@astoycos]) found a possible solution [client-go:Issue#410] and
Dave ([@dave-tucker]) suggested [kubernetes-api:podspec-v1-core].

[client-go:Issue#410]: https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/issues/410 
[kubernetes-api:podspec-v1-core]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.26/#podspec-v1-core 

### netify Preview in Github Removed (Jan 11)

Lastly, there was a discussion on the `netify` preview being removed from github
and a reminder why.
Dave ([@dave-tucker]) explained that with the docs release history now in place,
"current" is from a branch and it is not easy to preview.
So for now, document developers need to run mkdocs locally (See [generate-documention]).

## January 18, 2024

### RPM Builds and Socket Activation (Jan 18)

RPM Builds for `bpfman` went in fairly recently and Billy ([@billy99])
had some questions around their implementation.
RPM and Socket Activation were developed and merged around the same
time and the RPM builds are not installing socket activation properly.
Just verifying that RPMs should be installing the `bpfman.socket` file.
And they should.
There were also some questions on how to build RPMs locally.
Verified that `packit build locally` is the way forward.

> **Note:** Socket activation was added to RPM Builds along with documentation
> on building and using RPMs in [PR#922]

[PR#922]: https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/pull/922

### KubeCon EU Discussion (Jan 18)

With KubeCon EU just around the corner (March 19-22, 2024 in Paris), discussion
around bpfman talks and who was attending.
Dave ([@dave-tucker]) is probably attending and Shane ([@shaneutt]) might attend.
So if you are planning on attending KubeCon EU and are interested in `bpfman` or
just eBPF, keep an eye out for these guys for some lively discussions!
